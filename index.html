            My Name is Getro Naissance and I am From Fort Lauderdale, Fl. I have a bachelors degree from the University of Florida. I have decided to take a class on programming because the field is quite exciting. Given the fact that I am a lifelong learner, I enjoy that fact that one is never done learning computer science. I am currently working for a startup in Florida by the name of 71lbs. I have been employed at Hollister and the French Department of education
